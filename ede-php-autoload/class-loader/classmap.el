;; Class loader based on a strong mapping between class names and files.
;;
;; To use it :
;;    (ede-php-autoload-project "My project"
;;                              :file "main.php"
;;                              :class-autoloads '(:class-map (("Class\\Name" . "file/name.php")
;;                                                            ("Class\\Name2" . "file/name2.php"))))
